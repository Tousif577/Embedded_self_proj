# ðŸš€ Day 4 â€“ Button Input & Debouncing (Arduino Uno R4 WiFi)

This project demonstrates various methods of using push buttons to control an LED, including software debouncing and long-press detection.

## ðŸ”§ Hardware Used
- Arduino Uno R4 WiFi
- Breadboard
- 2x Push Buttons
- 1x LED
- 1x 220Î© resistor
- Jumper wires

## ðŸ§ª Projects Included

### 1. Basic Button LED
Turns LED on while button is pressed.

### 2. Toggle LED with Debounce
Toggles LED ON/OFF on each press, with bounce handled using `millis()`.

### 3. Two Buttons LED Control
One button turns LED ON, another turns it OFF.

### 4. Long Press Detection
Short press toggles LED, long press turns it OFF.
